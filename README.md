# NEXTJS + Prismic CMS!

This was my first contact with some technologies used. Typescript and NextJs for example.
It was very interesting to see how easy it is to work with the routing part of Next and the different forms of data fetching .

With this project I've practiced:

 1. TypeScript
 2. Client Side Fetching
 3. Server Side Rendering
 4. Static Site Generation
 5. Dinamic Static Pages
 6. Incremental Static Generation (fallback)
 7. Custom 404 page
 8. Dinamic "import"
 9. Components Lazy Load
 10. SEO
 11. Prismic (CMS)
